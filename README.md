**Web app for taking annotations in LocalStorage.**

	KeepList is FREE software <3


We are going to add an annotation to our To-Do list with JavaScript (*Vanilla*), in a list that will be the container for all elements.

We can mark each item as completed or delete it. They can also be edited by two clicks, modifying the text, and one click to save the changes.

When the application starts, the task list is to be retrieved from localStorage within the web browser. It works offline too, of course.

Each time the user modifies a task, the arrangement itself will be modified, and it must be saved permanently, so that pending tasks remain there if the current tab is refreshed or even navigated to another page.

Fully keyboard accessible (except editing annotations). Contains two themes with light and dark mode.

<h2>Changes:</h2>

- Hide original h1.
- Adjust footer size and position.
